    <li>First step in the project I took was googling different password generator projects online.</li>
    <li>Found a project that I liked the look and functionality of compared to the one provided to us.</li>
    <li>Copied over the HTML and CSS files for that project.</li>
    <li>Removed unnecessary features from CSS and HTML page.</li>
    <li>The project I found had a tutorial video that went over the JavaScript page in detail about the tags that were used, what they do, and why we used certain syntax.</li>
    <li>Using the CSS file changed the colors for entire page. Also removed what seemed like an unnecessary h1.</li>
    <li>Changed out the fonts and had to research how to make a clipboard button as the one in tutorial didn't work for some reason.</li>
    <li>Currently two problems arise stopping completion - Generate button refuses to work and console is logging an error saying it doesn't recognize certain elements as elements.</li>
    <li>Resolved issue where addEventListener was popping up with errors, culprit was misplacement of script in html. Fixed(Thanks the help of some fresh eyes!)</li>
    <li>Fixed some typos that were causing errors in console.</li>
    <li>Fixed generate password button to finally work.</li>
